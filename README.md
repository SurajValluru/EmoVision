# EmoVision 

This app helps visually impaired person connect with their loved ones emotionally.

As a visually acute person, we take being able to know the emotion of our friends/family members emotions with their facial expressions for granted. This is not the case for visually impaired person. They have to guess others emotion by hearing, which can't be always known. This application helps them to remove that barrier.

This app is ease to access with big area (Cam Feed), where they can tap to know the emotion. Output is in form of audio or vibrator of device.

## Usage ü§ñ

Make sure that your surrounding is well-lit.

Tap on video to know the current emotion. Change output modes with bottom buttons.

By default, camera is set to rear camera.

Configurations:

- Custom vibration patterns
- Languages
- Camera

## Compatibility ‚öôÔ∏è

Compatible on Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave.

Vibration feature is compatible only to Android versions of above browsers.

Thats the reason why few features are deprecated in desktop version.

Using mobile mode in desktop redirects to desktop version.

If opened in desktop inspection mode as a mobile, app doesn't give correct emotion results.
