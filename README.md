## Installation

Run pip install -r requirements.txt

## Host Web Site

Required to be online to load complete page.

The website will be up and running at localhost:5000 by default.

Make sure that surrounding is well-lit, not dark.

## Compatibility

Compatible on Chromium based browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave.

Vibration feature is compatible only to Android versions of above browsers.

Thats the reason why few features are deprecated in desktop version.

And using mobile mode in desktop doesn't give correct emotion results.
